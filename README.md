**Traditional Chinese Medicine Terms, Knowledge and Records (TCM-TKR), which encompasses TCM terms, knowledge and records**

Traditional Chinese Medicine Terms, Knowledge and Records (TCM-TKR) is a comprehensive and systematic resource dedicated to preserving, organizing, and disseminating the rich heritage of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). This project encompasses a vast spectrum of TCM-related content, serving as a bridge between ancient wisdom and modern understanding.​

---
At its core, TCM-TKR includes an extensive collection of TCM terms — from fundamental concepts like "Qi" (vital energy), "Yin-Yang," and "Meridians" to specialized terminology related to herbal medicines, acupuncture points, and diagnostic methods. These terms are meticulously defined, cross-referenced, and contextualized to ensure clarity for both practitioners and enthusiasts, eliminating ambiguities that often arise from translations or regional variations.​

Beyond terminology, TCM-TKR encapsulates a wealth of TCM knowledge, spanning theoretical frameworks, clinical principles, and practical applications. This includes classic theories such as the Five Elements (Wu Xing) and Zang-Fu organ systems, as well as insights into disease etiology, pathogenesis, and treatment strategies. It also covers contemporary research and advancements that integrate TCM with modern science, offering a holistic view of how this ancient medical system continues to evolve.​

Complementing its focus on terms and knowledge, TCM-TKR features a curated archive of TCM records — historical texts, ancient manuscripts, clinical case studies, and herbal pharmacopoeias. These records, some dating back thousands of years, provide invaluable insights into the development of TCM over time. From the Huangdi Neijing (Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon) to rare handwritten prescriptions, each document is digitized, annotated, and made accessible to facilitate research, education, and preservation of this cultural treasure.​

Whether you are a student exploring TCM for the first time, a researcher seeking authoritative references, or a practitioner looking to deepen your expertise, TCM-TKR serves as a trusted repository that honors the depth and diversity of Traditional Chinese Medicine. By bringing together terms, knowledge, and records in one cohesive platform, it aims to foster a greater appreciation and understanding of TCM's role in global healthcare and cultural heritage.
